	 *"GOLDEN RULE #1" OF INTERVIEWING PATIENTS:
	Avoid "closed-ended-questions" when interviewing patients about anything!
	
	A "closed-ended-question" is one that can be answered with a "yes" or a "no." 
	"How's your breathing?" or
	"How does your chest feel?"
	If a patient says, "My chest feels really tight!" do not later refer to his complaint as chest "pain." He didn't complain of chest "pain." 
	He complained of chest "tightness."
	GOLDEN RULE #3" OF INTERVIEWING PATIENTS:
	Denial = Positive Confirmation. If a patient denies complaints involving a specific area/function, require him to confirm that there is nothing wrong with that area/function.
	
	THE SAMPLE HISTORY SECRETS:
	SIGNS/SYMPTOMS
	
	Part One: "What's wrong?" ... "What's bothering you?" ...
	Part Two: "What else?" ... "Where else?" ... "What else?" ...
	(Patient's complaints don't "go" anywhere!)
	Part Three: The Head-To-Toe Open-Ended-Question Survey
	"How does your head feel?" ... "How does your neck feel?" ... and so on.
	ALLERGIES
	Part One: "What are you allergic to?"
	Part Two: "What else?" ... "What else?" ... "What else?" ...
	MEDICATIONS - 4 Questions (at least!):
	"What medications do you take?"
	"What other medications do you take?" ... "What else?" ... "What else?!" ...
	"What medications are you supposed to be taking, but aren't?" ... "What else?" ... "What else?!" ...
	"What medications are you taking in a way that is different from how you were told to take them?" ... "What else?" ... "What else?!" ...
	PAST MEDICAL HISTORY
	Part One: "What medical problems or physical injuries have you had, and when did you have them?"
	Part Two: "What else - when?" ... "Where else - when?" ...
	LAST ORAL INTAKE
	Part One: "When did you last eat or drink anything?"
	Part Two: "What else?" ... "Where else?" ... "What else?" ...
	EVENTS LEADING TO THIS EPISODE OF INJURY OR ILLNESS
	Part One: "What kinds of things were going on, or what were you doing, before this happened?"
	Part Two: "What else?" ... "Where else?" ... "What else?" ...
